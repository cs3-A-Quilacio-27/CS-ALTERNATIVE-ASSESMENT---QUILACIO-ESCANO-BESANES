            <div class="div_history1">
                <br>On July 5, 2012, the board of trustees of the Philippine Science High School System approved Resolution No. 20127-24 for the establishment of the 13th Campus of the Philippine Science High School System. The resolution aimed to address the need for optimal distribution of resources and opportunities for a quality secondary education in STEM for gifted students in Region 13 and neighboring areas.</br>
                <br>The Philippine Science High School - Caraga Region Campus began its formative academic and administrative years at Caraga State University from 2014 to 2016 while the construction of PSHS buildings were underway.</br>
                <br>On July 7, 2017, PSHS CRC officially moved to its own 5-hectare lot donated by the city government of Butuan in Barangay Ampayon, Butuan City.</br>
                <br>Today, PSHS CRC houses 594 scholars who have been influencing the region with PSHS values of integrity, excellence, and service.</br>
                <br>At PSHS CRC, we believe in the power of knowledge. Our dedicated faculty, laying the foundation for specialized secondary education and diverse academic programs, empower students to pursue their passions and shape their future.</br>
                <br>Academic excellence is at the core of our mission. Over the past academic years, our faculty and students have excelled in teaching, research, and learning, achieving success in national and international competitions. Our students not only excel in academics but also in various extracurricular activities, from sports to arts and culture.</br>
                <br>Beyond these walls, PSHS CRC actively engages with the local community in outreach programs and initiatives, such as PisAYUDA during the COVID-19 lockdown, and responding to calamities like Typhoon Odette and flooding in Surigao del Sur through initiatives like Iskobigayan. The school shares its knowledge and expertise through science camps, workshops, and seminars.</br>
                <br>In 2021, the commitment to quality was recognized with the ISO 9001:2015 certification for the quality management system.</br>
                <br>Our alumni are testaments to the quality of education here, achieving great success in various fields. Looking ahead, PSHS CRC is committed to continuing the tradition of excellence, nurturing the minds of future leaders, scientists, and innovators.</br>
